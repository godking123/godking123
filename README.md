## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rajit Sareen and I am an undergraduate Computer science and Engineering student at the University of Washington. I am experienced with Java, TypeScript, and JavaScript, and am currently working on learning Python and its data science related libraries. I am always looking to learn and build something new, productive, innovative and creative.

- ðŸ”­ A past project I enjoyed was Cube Companion, a full stack web application made for speedcubers. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AI, ML, Python, Assembly, and C.
